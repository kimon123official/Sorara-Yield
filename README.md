# Sorara-Yield

This is a modified version of Infinite Yield and it is not made to steal/skid the original script. We just made a version that would get more updates requested by the community. This is made for educational purposes only and it is not made to infringe someones elses copyright. Again all the credits go to the original developers of Infinate Yield.
